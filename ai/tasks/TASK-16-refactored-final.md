# Mortgage Calculator Utility Files Refactoring

This task involved refactoring the mortgage calculator utility files to improve code structure, align with economic principles, and prepare for future extensions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a New Financial Math Module (src/utils/financialMath.ts)

This new module serves as the foundation for all financial calculations and includes:

- Enums for different interest calculation methods (ACTUAL_365, THIRTY_360, ACTUAL_ACTUAL)
- Enums for payment types (ANNUITY, DIFFERENTIATED)
- Core financial math functions extracted from the original code:
  - `calculateMonthlyPayment`: For annuity loan calculations
  - `daysBetween`: Calculate days between two dates
  - `daysInYear`: Calculate days in a year (accounting for leap years)
  - `calculateInterestForPeriod`: Calculate interest with support for different methods
  - `calculatePayoffDate`: Calculate loan payoff date

### 2. Refactored Mortgage Calculator (src/utils/mortgageCalculator.ts)

- Now uses the functions from the financial math module
- Added support for future extensions:
  - Payment type (annuity/differentiated)
  - Payment day of month
  - Effective interest rate calculation
- Improved code organization and readability

### 3. Refactored Amortization Schedule (src/utils/amortizationSchedule.ts)

- Now uses the interest calculation method from the financial math module
- Added support for different payment types
- Added support for different interest calculation methods
- Maintained all existing functionality for early payments
- Improved code structure and documentation

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Better Code Organization**: Separated core financial math into its own module
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns
3. **Preparation for Future Extensions**: Added support for:
   - Different payment types (annuity/differentiated)
   - Different interest calculation methods
   - Monthly payment day specification
4. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Better TypeScript interfaces and enums
5. **Better Documentation**: Improved comments and code structure

## Future Considerations

The refactoring has prepared the codebase for several future enhancements:

1. **Payment Types**: Implementation of differentiated payment calculations
2. **Interest Calculation Methods**: Support for 30/360 and Actual/Actual methods
3. **Payment Day Specification**: Allow users to specify the day of the month for payments
4. **Financial Metrics**: Add more advanced financial metrics and analysis tools
5. **Economic Factors**: Account for inflation and other economic factors in long-term analysis

The code structure now provides a solid foundation for these future enhancements while maintaining all existing functionality.
