# TASK-18: Chart Improvements

## Overview

This task focused on enhancing the chart components to improve their functionality, add more data, and improve visibility for users to better understand the pros and cons of early payments. We've added several new chart types to provide more comprehensive visualization of mortgage data.

## Changes Made

### LineChart Improvements

1. **MM/YY Date Format**: 
   - Changed the x-axis labels from month numbers to MM/YY format
   - Implemented in `ChartsContainer.tsx` by formatting the date from the amortization schedule

2. **Dual Y-Axis Configuration**: 
   - Properly configured the chart with dual y-axes to better display payment amounts and balance data
   - Added appropriate axis titles and styling
   - Ensured the balance axis (right side) has a different scale than the payment axis (left side)

3. **Enhanced Tooltips**: 
   - Added formatted currency values in tooltips using the localization system
   - Implemented proper currency formatting based on user's language settings

4. **Early Payment Information**: 
   - Added detailed information about early payments in the tooltips
   - Shows the extra payment amount and type (reduce term or reduce payment)
   - Only displays this information when an early payment exists for that month

### PieChart Improvements

1. **Payment Distribution Chart**: 
   - Added a pie chart showing the distribution between principal and interest payments
   - Uses consistent colors with the line chart for better visual correlation

2. **Interest Savings Chart**: 
   - Added a conditional pie chart that appears only when early payments exist
   - Shows the new total interest after early payments and interest saved
   - Helps users visualize the impact of their early payments

3. **Enhanced Tooltips**: 
   - Added formatted tooltips that show the label, amount, and percentage
   - Uses the localization system for proper currency formatting

### New Chart Types

1. **BarChart Component**:
   - Created a new BarChart component for visualizing monthly payment breakdowns
   - Shows principal vs interest payments over time
   - Samples data points for better visibility with longer loan terms
   - Includes formatted tooltips with currency values

2. **DoughnutChart Component**:
   - Created a new DoughnutChart component (similar to PieChart but with a hole in the center)
   - Shows total payment breakdown including principal, interest, and extra payments
   - Provides a more comprehensive view of payment distribution
   - Includes percentage calculations in tooltips

3. **RadarChart Component**:
   - Created a new RadarChart component for comparing mortgage metrics
   - Compares original mortgage vs mortgage with early payments
   - Shows normalized values (as percentages) for loan term, total interest, and monthly payment
   - Only appears when early payments exist
   - Provides an intuitive visual representation of the impact of early payments

### Localization Support

1. **Added New Translation Keys**:
   - Added new translation keys for chart labels and tooltips
   - Implemented in both English and Russian languages
   - Keys include: paymentAmount, paymentDistribution, interestSavings, newTotalInterest, interestSaved

## Technical Implementation

1. **ChartsContainer.tsx**:
   - Added imports and implementations for all chart types (Line, Pie, Bar, Doughnut, Radar)
   - Created new data structures for each chart type
   - Added conditional rendering for charts that only appear with early payments
   - Implemented MM/YY date formatting for x-axis labels
   - Added extraction of early payment information for tooltips
   - Added data sampling for bar chart to improve visibility with long loan terms

2. **LineChart.tsx**:
   - Enhanced tooltip configuration to show formatted currency values
   - Added support for displaying early payment information
   - Implemented proper dual y-axis configuration
   - Added localization support for axis titles and tooltips

3. **PieChart.tsx**:
   - Added enhanced tooltip configuration
   - Implemented percentage calculation for pie chart segments
   - Added localization support for tooltips

4. **BarChart.tsx** (New):
   - Created new component for bar chart visualization
   - Implemented stacked/unstacked options
   - Added formatted tooltips with currency values
   - Added localization support

5. **DoughnutChart.tsx** (New):
   - Created new component similar to PieChart but with center hole
   - Implemented enhanced tooltips with percentages
   - Added hover effects for better interaction
   - Added localization support

6. **RadarChart.tsx** (New):
   - Created new component for comparing mortgage metrics
   - Implemented specialized tooltip formatting based on data type
   - Added support for normalized percentage values
   - Added localization support

7. **translations.ts**:
   - Added new translation keys for all chart types and labels
   - Implemented translations in both English and Russian

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: The MM/YY date format makes it easier to understand the timeline of payments.

2. **Better Data Visualization**: The dual y-axis configuration properly separates payment and balance data.

3. **Enhanced Information**: The tooltips provide more detailed information, especially about early payments.

4. **Visual Impact of Early Payments**: The interest savings chart clearly shows the benefits of making early payments.

5. **Multiple Visualization Options**: Different chart types provide various perspectives on the same data:
   - Line chart shows trends over time
   - Bar chart provides clear monthly comparisons
   - Pie/Doughnut charts show proportional distributions
   - Radar chart enables direct comparison between scenarios

6. **Comparative Analysis**: The radar chart specifically helps users understand the relative impact of early payments on different mortgage aspects (term, interest, payment).

7. **Data Sampling**: For longer loan terms, the bar chart implements data sampling to maintain readability while still showing the overall pattern.

8. **Localization Support**: All chart elements respect the user's language settings.

## Future Improvements

1. **Chart Annotations**: Could add visual annotations to mark early payment points on the line chart.

2. **Interactive Elements**: Could add interactive elements to allow users to hover/click on chart segments for more details.

3. **Comparison View**: Could add a toggle to show/hide the original amortization schedule for direct comparison.

4. **Export Functionality**: Could add the ability to export chart data or images.
