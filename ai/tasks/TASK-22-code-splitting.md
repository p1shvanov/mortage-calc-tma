# TASK-22: Code Splitting & Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This task implements code splitting and optimization techniques to improve the application's performance, reduce initial load time, and optimize the bundle size.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Route-based Code Splitting

- Implemented React.lazy and Suspense for main route components in `Router.tsx`
- Created a LoadingFallback component to display during chunk loading
- This ensures that only the code needed for the current route is loaded initially

```tsx
// Lazy load route components
const LoanForm = lazy(() => import('@/forms/LoanForm/LoanForm'));
const MortageResult = lazy(() => import('@/components/MortageResult'));

// Usage with Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
  <LoanForm />
</Suspense>
```

### 2. Component-level Code Splitting

- Enhanced existing code splitting in `ChartsContainer.tsx` 
- Added code splitting for the PieChart component in `PaymentSchedule.tsx`
- This ensures heavy components like charts are only loaded when needed

### 3. Build Optimization with Vite

- Configured manual chunk splitting for vendor libraries:
  - React and routing libraries
  - Telegram UI components
  - Chart.js and related libraries
  - Form-related libraries
- Enabled source maps for production builds
- Configured Terser for minification with optimized settings
- Added bundle visualization for monitoring bundle size

```js
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        'vendor-react': ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
        'vendor-telegram': ['@telegram-apps/sdk-react', '@telegram-apps/telegram-ui'],
        'vendor-charts': ['chart.js', 'react-chartjs-2'],
        'vendor-forms': ['@tanstack/react-form', 'zod', '@react-input/number-format'],
      },
    },
  },
  sourcemap: true,
  minify: 'terser',
  // ...
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Initial Load Time**: Only essential code is loaded initially, reducing the time to interactive
2. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Splitting code into chunks prevents loading unnecessary code
3. **Better Caching**: Vendor libraries are separated, allowing for better browser caching
4. **Improved Performance**: Lazy loading heavy components like charts improves overall application performance
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Bundle visualization helps identify optimization opportunities

## How to Monitor

After building the application with `npm run build`, a `stats.html` file will be generated in the `dist` directory. This file provides a visual representation of the bundle size and composition, helping identify further optimization opportunities.

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. Implement prefetching for anticipated routes
2. Consider implementing a service worker for caching
3. Further optimize image assets if applicable
4. Explore tree-shaking opportunities for large dependencies
