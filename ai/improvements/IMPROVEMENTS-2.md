# Mortgage Calculator TMA - Final Improvements

After reviewing the technical specifications and the refactored tasks, I've identified several areas that need adjustment based on your feedback. This document outlines the final improvements to ensure the project aligns with your requirements.

## Key Adjustments

### 1. Removing Jest Testing

As per your feedback, test coverage is not needed at this point. All Jest-related code and testing sections have been removed from the tasks to simplify the implementation.

### 2. React Hook Form Evaluation

The improvements document suggested using React Hook Form for form validation. While React Hook Form is a powerful library that can simplify form handling, it's not necessary for our relatively simple forms. 

**Recommendation**: Stick with the manual form validation approach as implemented in the original tasks. This avoids adding an extra dependency and keeps the codebase simpler. The current implementation already handles:
- Input validation
- Error messages
- Form state management

### 3. Maximizing TelegramUI Integration

The refactored tasks introduced several custom components that could be replaced with TelegramUI components. We should maximize the use of TelegramUI components wherever possible.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Use TelegramUI's `Table` component for the payment schedule instead of creating a custom virtualized table
- Use TelegramUI's form components consistently throughout the application
- Leverage TelegramUI's layout components for responsive design

### 4. Dependency Management

The refactored tasks introduced additional dependencies that aren't strictly necessary:

**Dependencies to Avoid**:
- `react-hook-form`: Not needed for our simple forms
- `react-virtual`: Not needed if we use TelegramUI's table component

**Required Dependencies**:
- `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`: Necessary for the graphical visualizations

## Final Task Structure

### TASK-11: Graphical Display Implementation

The implementation should:
- Use Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for visualizations
- Create pie and line charts for mortgage data visualization
- Ensure charts are responsive and theme-aware
- Support localization for all chart labels
- Use TelegramUI's `Section` component for layout

### TASK-12: Payment Schedule Implementation

The implementation should:
- Use TelegramUI's `Table` component for the payment schedule
- Implement pagination for navigating through payments
- Ensure the table is responsive and theme-aware
- Support localization for all table headers and content

### TASK-13: Early Payment Functionality

The implementation should:
- Use TelegramUI form components for the early payment form
- Implement manual form validation (no React Hook Form)
- Create a list of scheduled early payments with remove functionality
- Update results display to show the impact of early payments
- Update charts and payment schedule to reflect early payments

## Implementation Approach

1. **Simplify Component Structure**: Focus on creating components that are easy to understand and maintain.

2. **Maximize TelegramUI Usage**: Use TelegramUI components wherever possible to ensure consistent design and behavior.

3. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only add dependencies that are absolutely necessary for the core functionality.

4. **Optimize Performance**: Implement basic performance optimizations like memoization for expensive calculations.

5. **Ensure Accessibility**: Make sure all components are accessible and usable on different devices.

## Conclusion

By implementing these adjustments, we'll create a mortgage calculator that:
- Is lightweight and has minimal dependencies
- Maximizes the use of TelegramUI components
- Provides all the required functionality without unnecessary complexity
- Is easy to maintain and extend in the future

These improvements align with your feedback and will result in a more streamlined and focused implementation.
