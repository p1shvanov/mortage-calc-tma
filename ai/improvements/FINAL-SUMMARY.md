Based on your feedback, I've made several important adjustments to the technical specifications to better align with your requirements. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Jest Testing

- Removed all Jest-related code and testing sections from the tasks
- Simplified the implementation by focusing only on the core functionality
- This will make the development process more straightforward

### 2. Eliminated React Hook Form Dependency

- Kept the manual form validation approach as implemented in the original tasks
- This approach is sufficient for our relatively simple forms
- Avoided adding an extra dependency, keeping the codebase simpler
- The current implementation already handles input validation, error messages, and form state management effectively

### 3. Maximized TelegramUI Integration

- Updated all components to use TelegramUI components wherever possible
- Used TelegramUI's `Table` component for the payment schedule instead of a custom virtualized table
- Ensured consistent use of TelegramUI form components throughout the application
- Leveraged TelegramUI's layout components for responsive design

### 4. Streamlined Dependencies

- Removed unnecessary dependencies:
  - `react-hook-form`: Not needed for our simple forms
  - `react-virtual`: Not needed as we're using TelegramUI's table component
- Kept only essential dependencies:
  - `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`: Necessary for the graphical visualizations
  - `@telegram-apps/telegram-ui` and `@telegram-apps/sdk-react`: Core UI and SDK components

## Task Structure

The tasks have been refactored to reflect these changes:

1. **TASK-11: Graphical Display Implementation**
   - Uses Chart.js for visualizations
   - Maximizes TelegramUI components for layout
   - Implements responsive and theme-aware charts

2. **TASK-12: Payment Schedule Implementation**
   - Uses TelegramUI's Table component
   - Implements pagination for navigating through payments
   - Ensures responsive and theme-aware display

3. **TASK-13: Early Payment Functionality**
   - Uses TelegramUI form components
   - Implements manual form validation (no React Hook Form)
   - Updates results display to show the impact of early payments

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Development**: By removing Jest testing and React Hook Form, the development process will be more straightforward and focused on core functionality.

2. **Consistent UI**: Maximizing the use of TelegramUI components ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies mean a lighter application with fewer potential points of failure.

4. **Better Integration**: The application will be better integrated with the Telegram Mini App environment.

These changes will result in a more streamlined, focused implementation that meets all the requirements while being easier to develop and maintain.
